# AB Testing Campaign Summary

## Executive Summary
1. <b>Is the test campaign more effective at converting customers?</b>  
No. While the test campaign's click-through rate is significantly higher, the conversion rate is significantly lower.
   
2. <b>Is the test campaign more cost-efficient?</b>  
No. There is no real difference in cost to acquire a customer between campaigns.
   
3. <b>What is the main takeaway from these results?</b>  
The test campaign is not a better conversion campaign than the current campaign.
  
4. <b>What are the recommended next steps?</b>  
Though we can continue running the test campaign to acquire more data, we are unlikely to see a significant increase in conversions.

  So, a few other options are:  
- We can run experiments to determine why the CTR increased to help us improve CTR across our awareness and conversion campaigns  
- Run more A/B tests with a focus on increasing conversion rates.

## Visualizations
Here, we can see a significant increase in CTR in the test campaign compared to the control campaign. When running statistical tests, it was confirmed to be statistically significant, with a real increase of around 3.2%

In this figure, we can see that the test campaign performed slightly worse when converting customers. Statistical tests confirm it was statistically significant, with a real decrease of around 1.1%.

Looking at the cost-per-click comparison, we can see a slightly worse performance by the test campaign, but statistical tests do not confirm it to be statistically significant. So, it would be unlikely to see a real difference in CTR between campaigns had this campaign run for longer.

In this last figure, which compares the cost per acquisition, we can see a rise in the cost for the test campaign, but once again, statistical tests do not confirm it to be statistically significant. So, it is unlikely to see a real difference in CPA between campaigns had this campaign run for a longer period of time.
