# AB Testing Campaign Summary

1. <b>Is the test campaign more effective at converting customers?</b>  
No. While the test campaign's click-through rate is significantly higher, the conversion rate is significantly lower.
   
2. <b>Is the test campaign more cost-efficient?</b>  
No. There is no real difference in cost to acquire a customer between campaigns.
   
3. <b>What is the main takeaway from these results?</b>  
The test campaign is not a better conversion campaign than the current campaign.
  
4. <b>What are the recommended next steps?</b>  
Though we can continue running the test campaign to acquire more data, we are unlikely to see a significant increase in conversions.  
  So, a few other options are:
   - We can run experiments to determine why the CTR increased to help us improve CTR across our awareness and conversion campaigns  
   - Run more A/B tests with a focus on increasing conversion rates.
